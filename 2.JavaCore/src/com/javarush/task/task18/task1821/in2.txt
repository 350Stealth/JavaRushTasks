Specifying the Exported Fields
Specify the data that Simcenter STAR-CCM+ exports to Simcenter Amesim. As Simcenter Amesim is a 1D code, Simcenter STAR-CCM+ must send single-value fields to the Simcenter Amesim ports.
In this tutorial, you create reports to calculate the mass flow at the pipe outlet and the force acting on the plate, and export them to Simcenter Amesim ports 1 and 2, respectively.
To create the reports:
1. Right-click the Reports node and select New Report > Mass Flow.
2. Select the Mass Flow 1 node and set Parts to Regions > Pipe > Outlet.
3. In a similar way, create a report of type Force and set its Parts to Regions > Plate > Plate.
Add the reports to the exported fields:
4. Expand the Co-Simulations > Link 1 node.
5. Right-click the Conditions > Exported Fields node and select Add Auxiliary Field > Scalar.
6. Rename the Exported Fields > Scalar Auxiliary Field 1 node to MassFlow and set Scalar Function to Reports > Report: Mass Flow 1.
7. In a similar way, add another scalar auxiliary field named Force and set its Scalar Function property to Reports > Report: Force 1.
Make sure that each exported field is associated with the correct Simcenter Amesim port:
8. Expand the Link 1 > Conditions > Simcenter Amesim Port Associations node and set the following properties:
Node

Setting
MassFlow
	
Associated ID

9. Save the simulation.
